# -Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis-Dashboard-Tableau-Project
I recently completed a detailed customer churn analysis dashboard using Tableau, focusing on banking data for 10,000 customers. This dashboard provides key insights that can help financial institutions identify at-risk customers and take proactive steps to improve retention.

🔍 Key Insights:

Churn Rate: 48.49% of total customers (4,849 out of 10,000) have churned.

Country-wise Churn: Highest churn from France, followed by Germany and Spain.

Churn by Gender: Majority churn observed among Male customers.

Churn by Age: Peak churn is in the 35–40 age group, with declining rates in older demographics.

Tenure-wise Churn: Moderate churn across tenure, with notable consistency from 1–9 years.

Credit Holders: 70.55% of customers hold credit cards, offering segmentation opportunities.

🔧 Tools Used:

This project helped me sharpen my skills in data visualization, trend analysis, and business intelligence storytelling. I'm open to feedback, opportunities, and collaborations in the analytics and BI space.
